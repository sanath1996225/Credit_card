Credit Card Fraud Detection Project ReadMe

Abstract:
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, causing substantial financial losses annually. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques for accurate fraud detection using a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions. Various algorithms are explored and compared to identify the most effective approach for detecting fraudulent transactions.

Introduction:
Credit card fraud poses risks to both financial institutions and customers. Traditional fraud detection methods can be time-consuming and ineffective, prompting the use of machine learning for enhanced detection. This project focuses on building a model to identify fraudulent transactions, evaluating its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Dataset:
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains 31 variables representing credit card transactions. The response variable is binary (0 or 1), indicating non-fraudulent or fraudulent transactions. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model evaluation.

Methodology:
Supervised Machine Learning: The project employs supervised learning algorithms, necessitating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data understanding and preprocessing.

Data Cleaning: Identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in the dataset to enhance model accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze "class," "Amount," and "Time" columns to gain insights, identify patterns, and inform further preprocessing.

Feature Engineering: Normalize data using Power Transformation and create new features for improved model performance.

Train and Test Split: Utilize 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing to evaluate model performance.

Resampling Techniques: Implement oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE to address class imbalance issues.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Evaluate various algorithms including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

Results:
Confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons for each algorithm on different datasets (original, oversampled, undersampled, SMOTE) are provided.

Conclusion:
The XGBoost model with oversampling demonstrates consistent performance and is recommended for credit card fraud detection. However, careful implementation and tuning are crucial to avoid overfitting. The conclusion emphasizes the need for continuous model monitoring and updates.

Future Work:
Suggestions for future improvements include enhancing data collection, exploring additional features, tuning algorithm parameters, experimenting with ensemble methods, considering deep learning approaches, and implementing real-time fraud detection.
